              <h1>Why Telehealth?</h1>
              <p>
              Why do I provide therapy via telehealth?  While many health issues benefit from in-person care, 
              due to the nature of talk-therapy, I find that the convenience of telehealth outweighs the 
              benefits of meeting in person. We are able to commit to a regular therapy schedule without
               factoring in added barriers such as finding transportation, commuting to and from an office,
                finding childcare, or spreading illness.  As a result, far fewer appointments are missed and 
                more time is spent focusing on our work together.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
              To streamline the process and fully safeguard our sessions, I use Doxy.me. Doxy.me is a HIPPA
               compliant video conferencing platform for health professionals that offers a simple and secure
                means for us to meet. It is web-based, so no download is required, and you donâ€™t even have to
                 create an account. All data is encrypted, your sessions are anonymous, and your personal 
                 health information remains secure. 
                 <br></br>
                 <br></br> 
              Accepting Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Massachusetts and private pay. Please confirm with your 
              health insurance that you are covered for teletherapy sessions. 
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              To best take advantage of this system, appointment times should be scheduled for when you have 
              access to a private space and are able to focus on our session. I look forward to seeing you!
